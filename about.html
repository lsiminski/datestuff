    		<p>Every day a new adulting tip, trick, or tutorial will appear on the homepage and link you to an external source for you to read or watch. Referring back to this website every day for a year will undoubtedly help you in the present and future when you find yourself faced with the typical tasks of adulthood. If you reach a day in which the topic seemingly appears as though it'll never apply to you&mdash;read it anyway&mdash;you'll be prepared as soon as it does.</p><br>
    		<p>Essentially, if you do this every day for an entire year, you'll be 365x (+1 bonus if it's a leap year) more of a knowledgeable adult than you ever were before discovering this website.</p><br>
    		<p>Miss a day? Need to refer back to a previous post? In a super rush to grow up? Have no fear! You can <span class="contentlink"><a href="http://laurensiminski.com/adulting/list.html">view every tip in one place</a></span> and catch up or even get ahead of the game.</p>
